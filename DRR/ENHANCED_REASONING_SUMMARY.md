- No pattern recognition
- Basic information synthesis
- No logical connection analysis

### ✅ **Enhanced Reasoning Features:**

## 1. 🧩 **Advanced Reasoning Patterns**

### **Multiple Reasoning Types:**

    'inductive': ['suggests', 'indicates', 'implies', 'points to', 'evidence shows'],
    'abductive': ['likely', 'probably', 'best explanation', 'most plausible'],
    'causal': ['causes', 'leads to', 'results in', 'due to', 'because of'],
    'comparative': ['compared to', 'versus', 'in contrast', 'similarly', 'differently'],
    'analogical': ['like', 'similar to', 'analogous', 'comparable', 'resembles']
}
```

    answer_quality * 0.3 +           # Answer comprehensiveness
    insight_boost +                  # Key insights found
    pattern_boost                    # Reasoning pattern quality
)
```

### **Confidence Boosts:**
- **High similarity (>0.7)**: 70% similarity + 30% answer quality
- **Medium similarity (>0.5)**: 60% similarity + 40% answer quality
- **Pattern recognition**: +0.1 for advanced patterns (deductive, inductive, causal)
- **Insight discovery**: +0.1 per key insight (max 0.2)
- **Minimum confidence**: 0.4 for any retrieved content

## 4. 🔗 **Advanced Context Awareness**

### **Comprehensive Context Building:**

### **Context Integration:**
```python
context_info = f"Original Query: {original_query}\n\n"
context_info += "Previous Reasoning Context:\n"
for key, value in context.items():
    context_info += f"- {value.get('answer', '')[:150]}...\n"
    if 'insights' in value:
        context_info += f"  Key insights: {', '.join(value['insights'][:2])}\n"
```

## 5. 🎯 **Pattern-Specific Reasoning**

## 6. 📈 **Advanced Metrics and Assessment**

### **Enhanced Quality Assessment:**
```python
if avg_confidence > 0.7 and total_sources > 3 and total_insights > 5 and reasoning_diversity > 2:
    return "Exceptional reasoning quality with diverse patterns and strong evidence"
elif avg_confidence > 0.6 and total_sources > 2 and total_insights > 3 and reasoning_diversity > 1:
    return "High quality reasoning with multiple patterns and good evidence"
```
