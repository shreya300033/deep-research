Information gathered for 'Gather factual information': 
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create 
                intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. 
                These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.
                
                AI can be categorized into two main types: Narrow AI and General AI. Narrow AI is designed 
                to perform specific tasks, while General AI would have the ability to understand, learn, 
                and apply knowledge across different domains.
                
                Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data. 
                Deep Learning, in turn, is a subset of machine learn...
